Yesterday after two great years with a company I was laid off. the economy and oil industry is struggling. it finally affected my company and a small group of us who now are faced with a decision to make.

What now?

I have been a consultant for twenty years and I am always the first to go because I'm the easiest to cut. Less paper work and what not.

This is different though because I wasn't a contractor they convinced me to settle down and become an employee. So for a little more then two years I have been that employee working a j.o.b. (just over broker). I should be freaking out or nervous or scared. I have no real prospects right now. No clear future.

I am calm and clear. I feel like I just fell flat on my back while hiking. It is as if I got up brushed myself off but the need, the want, the urgency to get back on track, keep walking that trail is gone. I feel like for the first time I can go off road. Make my own trail.

So which way do I go? Should go slow or fast? Do I lead or follow someone? Do I do it alone? I have spent twenty plus years doing what I was good at, what was expected of me, working, earning, educating, grow into and entrepreneur before it was the cool thing to do. I have fallen and implode more times then I can remember. I am sure my father has kept count.

But now none of that matters I feel at peace. I am going to let the ether guide me and see where it wants me to go.

So todays day one of this new life.

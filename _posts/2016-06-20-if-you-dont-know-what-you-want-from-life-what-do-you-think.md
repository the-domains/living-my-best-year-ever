  The great majority of people in the world drift through life, never realizing
  that their future will be the one they create for themselves. The minority who
  achieve great success are people who know what they want and have a plan for
  realizing their objectives. They know what they want and how they are going to
  get it. Your goals should be specific, they should be measurable, they should
  have a deadline for their achievement, and they should be divided into
  manageable pieces. Know exactly what you plan to achieve, when you plan to
  achieve it, and how. Review your progress regularly, correct your course when
  necessary, and never, ever give up.

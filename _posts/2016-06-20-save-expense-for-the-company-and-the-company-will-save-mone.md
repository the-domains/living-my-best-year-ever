# **Save expense for the company, and the company will save money for you in proportion.**

The rewards may not come today, next week, or even next year, but they will come. When you make it a practice to look after the company's assets as you would look after your own, you have shown that you are worthy of the trust of your employer --- and your fellow employees. You are destined for bigger and better things. The savings need not be large. It's the habit of eliminating waste and searching for opportunities to save money that's important. Make it a practice to examine everything you do to see how it could be done more economically, and it is inevitable that you will soon find yourself in charge of larger budgets and more people.

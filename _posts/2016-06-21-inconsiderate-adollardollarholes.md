  A big guy my size, linebacker size, and I just had a nice laugh at Biggby's
  coffee. We are both just sitting nice a quiet on our laptops with Headphones
  on and working away. All of a sudden like a Worrall wind this little guy comes
  up and is loud as hell on the phone and walking around. He doesn’t even try
  and quit down or be considerate. We can hear him over our head phones, even
  when we turn them up. Then to add insult to injury he walks like he’s twice
  our size stomping around shaking the whole dam place. Why do you little
  fuckers stomp like you’re a dam elephant but someone like me 3 times your size
  can walk normal almost like a ninja? This little asshole shook the entire
  floor with every fucking step. I wanted to throw him over the balcony for not
  having respect for his environment. People these days are just rude and
  inconsiderate. Finally after ten minutes he packs up a leaves. I look at the
  other guy. We both start laughing, clapping for joy, and talking about it.
  Glad it wasn’t just me this guy was irritated too. We joked at the amazement
  of it all and went back to blissful quiet and work. Ah life….

# Inconsiderate A$$holes
